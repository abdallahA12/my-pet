    <hi>MY PET</hi>
    <h2>LETS TALK BOUT IT</h2>
    <p>my pet is commonly known as a monkey but in swahili as tumbiri</p>
    <p>It is the best animal i have come across as 40% of its behaviors are related to the one of human beings</p>
    <p>I get it to be somehow understandable as it can smile,laugh as you can know if its happy or sad</p>
